This project currently includes a ratio class which can compute NGU, beard, and advanced training speed to xp ratio for a given ratio of power, cap and bars.

It includes a python notebook that outputs these stats for a given ratio.

The notebook also contains a loop which searches for ratios that improve on some speeds of a given ratio while sacrifices its other speeds.
